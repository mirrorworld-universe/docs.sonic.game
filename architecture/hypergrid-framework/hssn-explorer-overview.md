# HSSN Explorer Overview

## Introduction

The Hypergrid Shared State Network (HSSN) is a Cosmos-based network that operates between the Grid and the Solana Base Layer. It manages state for all communications, including inter-grid interactions and periodic synchronization of block data from the grid as a rollup to the Solana base layer.

To monitor the HSSN's operations, a dedicated dashboard has been provisioned.&#x20;

## Relationship to Other Components

The HSSN Dashboard provides crucial insights into the operations of the HSSN, which plays a central role in the Grid ecosystem. It offers visibility into:

* Communication between Grids
* Synchronization with the Solana Base Layer
* Gas fee calculations and settlements

By providing this comprehensive view, the explorer dashboard enhances transparency and facilitates efficient management of the entire Grid ecosystem.
