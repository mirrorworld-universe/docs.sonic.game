# HyperGrid Framework

HyperGrid protocol is a rollup scaling and orchestration framework for dedicated Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) ecosystem rollup operators. HyperGrid utilizes state compression and Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) to achieve potentially infinite transaction throughput by enabling horizontal scaling across multiple grids, exemplified by Sonic – a gaming-specific grid that settles on Solana.

Among other things, a key feature of HyperGrid is [**Atomic Interoperability**](interoperability-with-solana/). HyperGrid is designed to be interoperable with Solana. It implements an interoperability interface that allows for wholly encapsulated programs on Solana to delegate execution to Grids orchestrated by HyperGrid. This approach offers several benefits:

* Creates a single source of truth for all programs running on Solana
* Facilitates the delegation of program computation to HyperGrid
* Enables rollups to benefit from the Base layer's services and liquidity
