# What is Sonic?

Sonic is the first atomic SVM (Solana Virtual Machine) chain engineered to enable sovereign game economies on Solana. Through its innovative HyperGrid framework, Sonic revolutionizes blockchain gaming by providing:

### Core Architecture

Atomic SVM Chain

Unlike traditional Layer 2 solutions that focus on transaction batching, Sonic's atomic SVM architecture enables:

* Direct state synchronization with Solana
* Native program compatibility without modifications
* Independent state management per grid
* True horizontal scaling through multi-grid design
