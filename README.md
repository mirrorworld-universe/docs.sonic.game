# Introducing Sonic

Sonic is the first atomic SVM chain built to enable sovereign game economies on Solana. Sonic enables sovereign game economies that rollup and settle on [Solana](https://solana.com/).

Sonic is built on top of the first concurrent scaling framework for Solana, called HyperGrid. Sonic is the first instance of a Grid orchestrated by this framework.

HyperGrid is designed to introduce customizability and scale, while remaining natively composable to Solana.

### Vision

**Sonic was built to unlock new experiences for both builders, and players. 💫**

We designed Sonic to be the brewing ground for  a world of high-performance decentralized gaming, creating a distinction from the traditional trading experience of in-game assets.&#x20;
