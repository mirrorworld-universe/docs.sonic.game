# Developer Tooling

In this section you will find some helpful information to help you during development. We have created some resources to make the development experience as smooth as butter:

1. [**Sonic Explorer**](explorer.md) - A web-based tool that provides detailed insights into the Solana blockchain, allowing users to view transactions, accounts, blocks, and network statistics in real-time.
2. [**Sonic Faucet**](faucet.md) - A web-based tool that airdrops development SOL for facilitating transaction fees on Sonic Devnet environment.
3. [**Wallet Extensions**](wallet-extensions.md) - If you're building on Sonic for the browser, we have curated a list of recommended browser wallets for Sonic. Support for more wallets is continuously on-going.
