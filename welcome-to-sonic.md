# Welcome to Sonic

> Sonic is the first atomic SVM (Solana Virtual Machine) chain engineered to enable sovereign game economies on Solana.&#x20;

It addresses a specific challenge in blockchain gaming: how to run complex games with high performance while maintaining true decentralization. As an atomic Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) chain, Sonic allows games to operate with their own economics while staying connected to Solana's security.

#### Sonic's Tech Stack

#### HyperGrid Framework

Sonic's HyperGrid framework transforms this landscape by enabling each game to operate in its own dedicated grid. This means a massively multiplayer game can handle thousands of concurrent player actions, while a trading card game can manage complex card interactions and marketplaces - all running simultaneously without competing for the same blockchain resources.

#### Sorada

Sorada represents a fundamental shift in our approach to SVM data architecture. By decoupling read operations from the core transaction processing pipeline, we've created a system that delivers unprecedented performance improvements for data retrieval.

Our testing shows a 30-40x improvement in read performance compared to standard RPC nodes. For all applications, this translates to response times as low as 5ms for read operations - a game-changing improvement that enables truly responsive blockchain gaming experiences.

#### Rush

Rush is Sonic's Entity-Component-System (ECS) framework, designed to make blockchain game development feel natural and approachable. It takes a declarative approach where game developers define their game's world, entities, and components using simple configuration files, eliminating the need to write complex blockchain code. Rather than requiring developers to learn intricate blockchain concepts, Rush generates all the necessary smart contracts and SDKs from these configurations.

Let's explore the Sonic ecosystem together, buckle up, its going to be awesome!!
