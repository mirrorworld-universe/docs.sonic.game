A faucet is a service that distributes free tokens, typically used in test environments like testnets or devnets, to enable developers to test their applications without spending real money.

These tokens have no real-world value but are essential for simulating transactions, testing smart contracts, and ensuring that applications function correctly in a controlled environment.
