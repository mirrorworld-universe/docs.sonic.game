# Clusters

Sonic has several different groups of validators, known as **Clusters**. Each serving different purposes within the overall ecosystem and containing dedicated api nodes to fulfill **JSON-RPC** requests for their respective Cluster.

The individual nodes within a Cluster are owned and operated by third parties, with a public endpoint available for each.
