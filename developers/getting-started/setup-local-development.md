# Setup local development

Sonic's local development environment should be very similar to setting up the Solana's local development environment.

## 1. Install the Solana CLI

Follow this [official guide](https://solana.com/developers/guides/getstarted/setup-local-development) to setup the Solana CLI locally. If you already have it setup, you may skip this step.

## 2. Configure your Sonic Cluster&#x20;

After setting up the Solana CLI, you can configure it to point to the Sonic Devnet Cluster for development. Learn more about Sonic's clusters [here](../infrastructure/clusters.md).

After installing the Solana CLI you can run the following command to ensure that it's correctly installed.

```bash
solana config get
```
